Remember not to add oil to the pasta water as it can prevent the sauce from adhering to the pasta properly. Apparatus Pot for cooking spaghetti Frying pan or stir fry pan Container for beating eggs Ingredients Standard spaghetti Salt (to taste) for boiling the spaghetti (Aromat recommended) Cooking oil (such as olive oil) for frying bacon Ground black pepper (about half a teaspoon) Two large eggs or bigger Pecorino cheese (recommended) or any other cheese you prefer within reasonable bounds Sliced bell peppers 100g diced bacon 80g sliced mushrooms (optional, but recommended) 1/2 tbsp sliced garlic 1/4 tbsp sage Method Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Make sure to add salt to the boiling water to season the pasta. Cook until al dente (firm to the bite), then drain the pasta and set it aside. Meanwhile, heat some cooking oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the diced bacon, garlic, and sliced bell peppers to the pan and cook until the bacon becomes crispy and the bell peppers are slightly softened. Reduce the heat to keep the mixture warm. In a separate container, break the eggs. Grate the pecorino cheese directly into the same container with the eggs. The amount of cheese can vary based on your preference, but a good starting point is about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of grated cheese. Sprinkle the sage and ground black pepper into the egg and cheese mixture, and whisk everything together until well combined. Set aside. Once the bacon and bell peppers are cooked, add the cooked spaghetti to the frying pan with the bacon and peppers. Stir everything together to combine. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the spaghetti in the pan. Stir continuously and vigorously to coat the spaghetti evenly with the sauce. The residual heat from the pan and spaghetti will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If desired, you can add sliced mushrooms to the pan at this stage. Stir them in with the spaghetti and sauce. Keep stirring the spaghetti and sauce over low heat until you achieve a creamy and thick consistency. Be careful not to cook the eggs too quickly or they may scramble. Once the cheese has melted into the spaghetti and the sauce coats the spaghetti well, remove the pan from the heat. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and additional black pepper if needed. Serve the carbonara immediately while it's still hot. You can garnish with some extra grated pecorino cheese and black pepper if desired. Enjoy your homemade carbonara!","title":"Carbonara Recipe (for two people)"},{"location":"recipes/Carbonara/#carbonara-recipe-for-two-people","text":"This recipe assumes that you know how to cook spaghetti.
